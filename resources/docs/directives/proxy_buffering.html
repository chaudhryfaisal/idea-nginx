Enables or disables buffering of responses from the proxied server.
</p><p>
When buffering is enabled, nginx receives a response from the proxied server
as soon as possible, saving it into the buffers set by the
<a href="#proxy_buffer_size">proxy_buffer_size</a> and <a href="#proxy_buffers">proxy_buffers</a> directives.
If the whole response does not fit into memory, a part of it can be saved
to a <a href="#proxy_temp_path">temporary file</a> on the disk.
Writing to temporary files is controlled by the
<a href="#proxy_max_temp_file_size">proxy_max_temp_file_size</a> and
<a href="#proxy_temp_file_write_size">proxy_temp_file_write_size</a> directives.
</p><p>
When buffering is disabled, the response is passed to a client synchronously,
immediately as it is received.
nginx will not try to read the whole response from the proxied server.
The maximum size of the data that nginx can receive from the server
at a time is set by the <a href="#proxy_buffer_size">proxy_buffer_size</a> directive.
</p><p>
Buffering can also be enabled or disabled by passing
“<code>yes</code>” or “<code>no</code>” in the
“X-Accel-Buffering” response header field.
This capability can be disabled using the
<a href="#proxy_ignore_headers">proxy_ignore_headers</a> directive.
