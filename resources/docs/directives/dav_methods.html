Allows the specified HTTP and WebDAV methods.
The parameter <code>off</code> denies all methods processed
by this module.
The following methods are supported:
<code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, <code>MKCOL</code>,
<code>COPY</code>, and <code>MOVE</code>.
</p><p>
A file uploaded with the PUT method is first written to a temporary file,
and then the file is renamed.
Starting from version 0.8.9, temporary files and the persistent store
can be put on different file systems.
However, be aware that in this case a file is copied
across two file systems instead of the cheap renaming operation.
It is thus recommended that for any given location both saved files and a
directory holding temporary files, set by the
<a href="ngx_http_core_module.html#client_body_temp_path">client_body_temp_path</a>
directive, are put on the same file system.
</p><p>
When creating a file with the PUT method, it is possible to specify
the modification date by passing it in the “Date”
header field.
