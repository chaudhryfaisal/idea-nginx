Activates the cache for connections to upstream servers.
</p><p>
The <code><i>connections</i></code> parameter sets the maximum number of
idle keepalive connections to upstream servers that are preserved in
the cache of each worker process.
When this number is exceeded, the least recently used connections
are closed.
</p> <blockquote class="note">
It should be particularly noted that the <code>keepalive</code> directive
does not limit the total number of connections to upstream servers
that an nginx worker process can open.
The <code><i>connections</i></code> parameter should be set to a number small enough
to let upstream servers process new incoming connections as well.
</blockquote><p> 
</p><p>
Example configuration of memcached upstream with keepalive connections:
</p> <blockquote class="example"><pre>
upstream memcached_backend {
    server 127.0.0.1:11211;
    server 10.0.0.2:11211;
    keepalive 32;
}
server {
    ...
    location /memcached/ {
        set $memcached_key $uri;
        memcached_pass memcached_backend;
    }
}
</pre></blockquote><p> 
</p><p>
For HTTP, the <a href="ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_http_version">proxy_http_version</a>
directive should be set to “<code>1.1</code>”
and the “Connection” header field should be cleared:
</p> <blockquote class="example"><pre>
upstream http_backend {
    server 127.0.0.1:8080;
    keepalive 16;
}
server {
    ...
    location /http/ {
        proxy_pass http://http_backend;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Connection "";
        ...
    }
}
</pre></blockquote><p> 
</p><p>
</p> <blockquote class="note">
Alternatively, HTTP/1.0 persistent connections can be used by passing the
“Connection: Keep-Alive” header field to an upstream server,
though this method is not recommended.
</blockquote><p> 
</p><p>
For FastCGI servers, it is required to set
<a href="ngx_http_fastcgi_module.html#fastcgi_keep_conn">fastcgi_keep_conn</a>
for keepalive connections to work:
</p> <blockquote class="example"><pre>
upstream fastcgi_backend {
    server 127.0.0.1:9000;
    keepalive 8;
}
server {
    ...
    location /fastcgi/ {
        fastcgi_pass fastcgi_backend;
        fastcgi_keep_conn on;
        ...
    }
}
</pre></blockquote><p> 
</p><p>
</p> <blockquote class="note">
When using load balancer methods other than the default
round-robin method, it is necessary to activate them before
the <code>keepalive</code> directive.
</blockquote><p> 
</p> <blockquote class="note">
SCGI and uwsgi protocols do not have a notion of keepalive connections.
