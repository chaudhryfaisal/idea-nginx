Sets the maximum number of requests that can be
served through one keepalive connection.
After the maximum number of requests is made, the connection is closed.
</p><p>
Closing connections periodically is necessary to free
per-connection memory allocations.
Therefore, using too high maximum number of requests
could result in excessive memory usage and not recommended.
