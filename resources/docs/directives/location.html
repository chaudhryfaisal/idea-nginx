Sets configuration depending on a request URI.
</p><p>
The matching is performed against a normalized URI,
after decoding the text encoded in the “<code>%XX</code>” form,
resolving references to relative path components “<code>.</code>”
and “<code>..</code>”, and possible
<a href="#merge_slashes">compression</a> of two or more
adjacent slashes into a single slash.
</p><p>
A location can either be defined by a prefix string, or by a regular expression.
Regular expressions are specified with the preceding
“<code>~*</code>” modifier (for case-insensitive matching), or the
“<code>~</code>” modifier (for case-sensitive matching).
To find location matching a given request, nginx first checks
locations defined using the prefix strings (prefix locations).
Among them, the location with the longest matching
prefix is selected and remembered.
Then regular expressions are checked, in the order of their appearance
in the configuration file.
The search of regular expressions terminates on the first match,
and the corresponding configuration is used.
If no match with a regular expression is found then the
configuration of the prefix location remembered earlier is used.
</p><p>
<code>location</code> blocks can be nested, with some exceptions
mentioned below.
</p><p>
For case-insensitive operating systems such as macOS and Cygwin,
matching with prefix strings ignores a case (0.7.7).
However, comparison is limited to one-byte locales.
</p><p>
Regular expressions can contain captures (0.7.40) that can later
be used in other directives.
</p><p>
If the longest matching prefix location has the “<code>^~</code>” modifier
then regular expressions are not checked.
</p><p>
Also, using the “<code>=</code>” modifier it is possible to define
an exact match of URI and location.
If an exact match is found, the search terminates.
For example, if a “<code>/</code>” request happens frequently,
defining “<code>location = /</code>” will speed up the processing
of these requests, as search terminates right after the first
comparison.
Such a location cannot obviously contain nested locations.
</p><p>
</p> <blockquote class="note">
In versions from 0.7.1 to 0.8.41, if a request matched the prefix
location without the “<code>=</code>” and “<code>^~</code>”
modifiers, the search also terminated and regular expressions were
not checked.
</blockquote><p> 
</p><p>
Let’s illustrate the above by an example:
</p> <blockquote class="example"><pre>
location = / {
    [ configuration A ]
}
location / {
    [ configuration B ]
}
location /documents/ {
    [ configuration C ]
}
location ^~ /images/ {
    [ configuration D ]
}
location ~* \.(gif|jpg|jpeg)$ {
    [ configuration E ]
}
</pre></blockquote><p> 
The “<code>/</code>” request will match configuration A,
the “<code>/index.html</code>” request will match configuration B,
the “<code>/documents/document.html</code>” request will match
configuration C,
the “<code>/images/1.gif</code>” request will match configuration D, and
the “<code>/documents/1.jpg</code>” request will match configuration E.
</p><p>
The “<code>@</code>” prefix defines a named location.
Such a location is not used for a regular request processing, but instead
used for request redirection.
They cannot be nested, and cannot contain nested locations.
</p><p>
If a location is defined by a prefix string that ends with the slash character,
and requests are processed by one of
<a href="ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_pass">proxy_pass</a>,
<a href="ngx_http_fastcgi_module.html#fastcgi_pass">fastcgi_pass</a>,
<a href="ngx_http_uwsgi_module.html#uwsgi_pass">uwsgi_pass</a>,
<a href="ngx_http_scgi_module.html#scgi_pass">scgi_pass</a>,
<a href="ngx_http_memcached_module.html#memcached_pass">memcached_pass</a>, or
<a href="ngx_http_grpc_module.html#grpc_pass">grpc_pass</a>,
then the special processing is performed.
In response to a request with URI equal to this string,
but without the trailing slash,
a permanent redirect with the code 301 will be returned to the requested URI
with the slash appended.
If this is not desired, an exact match of the URI and location could be
defined like this:
</p> <blockquote class="example"><pre>
location /user/ {
    proxy_pass http://user.example.com;
}
location = /user {
    proxy_pass http://login.example.com;
}
</pre></blockquote><p>
